    "## The History of IPython and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2001** -  Fernando Pérez started developing IPython - a more advanced Python shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2005** -  Robert Kern and Fernando Pérez attempted building a notebook system. Unfortunately, the prototype never become fully usable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2007** -  the IPython team had kept on working nd formulated another attempt at implementing a notebook-type system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2010 (October)** - there was a prototype of a web notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2011 (summer)** -  this prototype was incorporated and it was released with 0.12 on December 21, 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2013** - the team got awards, such as the Advancement of Free Software for Fernando Pérez and the Jolt Productivity Award, and funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundations, among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2014** -  *Project Jupyter* started as a spin-off project from IPython. IPython is now the name of the Python backend, which is also known as the kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "After all this, you might wonder where this idea of notebooks originated or how it came about to the creators.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief research into the history of these notebooks learns that Fernando Pérez and Robert Kern were working on a notebook just at the same time as the Sage notebook was a work in progress. Since the layout of the Sage notebook was based on the layout of Google notebooks, you can also conclude that also Google used to have a notebook feature around that time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For what concerns the idea of the notebook, it seems that Fernando Pérez, as well as William Stein, one of the creators of the Sage notebook, have confirmed that they were avid users of the Mathematica notebooks and Maple worksheets. The Mathematica notebooks were created as a front end or GUI in 1988 by Theodore Gray. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a notebook, which contains ordinary text and calculation and/or graphics, was definitely not new. \n",
    "For a journalistic canter through the history (and politics) - see [here.](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the developers had close contact with one another and this, together with other failed attempts at GUIs for IPython and the use of \"AJAX\" = web applications, which didn't require users to refresh the whole page every time you do something, were two other motivations for the team of William Stein to start developing the Sage notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more details, check out the personal accounts of [Fernando Pérez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_P%C3%A9rez_(software_developer)) and [William Stein](https://wstein.org/) about the history of their notebooks."
